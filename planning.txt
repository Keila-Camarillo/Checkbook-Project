- welcome user
- prompt an action
    -view current balance
    -add a debit
    -add a credit 
    -exit

prompt the user for an action - depending on the input



take the user to the current balance or the other options 
- what to do with the data      

if invalid input notify the user - input validation function

app should keep the balance -  r/w to a file
after section is completed keep prompting until they exit

Thought process:
1. identify the pieces
2. determine single run or multi-run 
- while true loop - condition that breaks for multi- use
3. what data and how to take in data 
    a. (data input and data type) take in data and what will it look like
    b. editing the data
4. Data persistence & input validation
